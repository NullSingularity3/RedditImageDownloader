# ArtSnap - Reddit Media Downloading Automator ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“¸
Welcome to ArtSnap, a simple Python wraper for effortlessly batch downloading media from Reddit! ðŸŒŸ 

This tool leverages the Reddit API and the PRAW library to seamlessly fetch post information and download the corresponding images.

# How tu run

## Preliminary

- clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kkinastowski66/reddit-image-download.git
```
- Create [`authorized reddit application`](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps), read about [`Reddit API`](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and obtain the necessary credentials, such as the client ID, client secret, username, password, and user agent. Store these credentials in a JSON file `user_credentials.json` in your local repository that you cloned.

```json
{
"username":"your reddit username",
"password":"pw to your reddit account",
"user_agent":"anything here",
"client_secret":"...",
"client_id":"..."
}
```


## Using Docker
To use the "Reddit Image Downloader", follow these steps:
 - Adjust the Dockerfile up to your preferences 
 ```shell
 # build docker image 
docker build -t reddit-image-downloader .
# run
 docker run -v /your/local/directory:/app/downloads reddit-image-downloader
 ```

## Standard method
 - Customize the constants.py file if needed, adjusting default file paths or other constants according to your preferences.
 - Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python3 -m reddit_image_downloader -u "user1" "user2" "user3"
```

The last command runs the script and downloads media from users given in list and saves it in separate directories.

## Pre-commit

To use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) during the development run:

```sh
python3 -m venv .vev
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` stores the `pre-commit` configuration.
